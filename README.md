**PROBLEMS ADDRESSED:**
The primary problem with real-time network traffic classification is developing efficient methods and systems that can accurately categorize network traffic data in real time.
There is a need for useful mobile traffic classifiers that can handle encrypted communication and accurately depict the intricate traffic patterns of such traffic based on automatically derived characteristics.
Enabling accurate mobile app identification from network traffic is the main difficulty. Improving a number of network operations, such as quality-of-service, accounting, security monitoring,
and traffic forecasting, requires taking this critical step.
As encryption techniques become more prevalent to ensure data privacy and security, traditional methods of traffic classification become ineffective. 
This poses a challenge for network administrators and security analysts who need to identify and analyze different types of network traffic.
